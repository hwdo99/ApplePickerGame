Intro to Game Programming Apple Picker Game

I initially created a master branch and uploaded my current Unity Projet at the time.
I then created a branch called "development" to work on changes and made various commits along the way.
After the "Change 7" commit, my project was all done, and I proceeded to merge the development branch into the master branch.
My project is now all done, and if you download the files from the master branch, you should be able to obtain my final Project 2B unity project!
